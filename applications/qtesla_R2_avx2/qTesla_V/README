# AVX2-optimized implementation of qTESLA-V

# Linux

To compile, do:

make 

which by default sets ARCH=x64, CC=gcc and DEBUG=FALSE, or do:

make CC=[gcc/clang] DEBUG=[TRUE/FALSE]

The following executables are generated: "test_qtesla-V", "PQCtestKAT_sign-V"
and "PQCgenKAT_sign-V".

To get cycle counts for key generation, signing and verification, execute:

./test_qtesla-V

To test against known answer values in the KAT folder, execute:

./PQCtestKAT_sign-V

To generate new KAT files, execute:

./PQCgenKAT_sign-V

Using DEBUG=TRUE generates statistics on acceptance rates and timings for internal functions.
